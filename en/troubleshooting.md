## Images are not displayed
- Make sure you run the command `php artisan storage:link`
- Ensure that the default disk is set to `public`, not `local`
- Check that `APP_URL` in the `.env` file is set correctly

```php
APP_URL=http://moonshine.test:8080
```

<a name="problems-with-https"></a>
## HTTPS issues
If you have forms that use URLs with http but expect https:

- Make sure you have a valid SSL certificate
- In the [`TrustProxies`](https://laravel.com/docs/requests#configuring-trusted-proxies) middleware, set `protected $proxies = ['*']`

<a name="error-page-not-found"></a>
## Error "Page not found"
- Check for the presence of MoonShineServiceProvider in `bootstrap/providers.php` or in `config/app.php`
For example, the Apiato package changes its structure, and **MoonShine** cannot be added as a provider automatically. Add it manually
- Ensure that the resource or page is declared in `MoonShineServiceProvider`
- Clear the cache
