## What is MoonShine

**MoonShine** is an open-source package for projects on `Laravel` (license `MIT`), designed for accelerated development of web projects. It is perfect for creating:

## Name history

The name "**MoonShine**" has an interesting origin. It refers not so much to "moonlight" as to the process of making drinks independently in illegal conditions under the cover of night. It is a metaphor for the process of developing an admin panel: creating a quality product "with soul" in one's free time, mainly at night, initially for personal use and for friends.
