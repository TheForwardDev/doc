## Concept
Fields play a crucial role in the **MoonShine** admin panel.
They are used in the `FormBuilder` for building forms, in the `TableBuilder` for creating tables, as well as in forming filters for `ModelResource` (CrudResource).
They can also be used in your custom pages and even outside the admin panel, both as objects and directly in **Blade**.

Fields are elements of a form, so their default rendering state is simply an HTML form element.

Creating an instance of a field is very simple.
There is a convenient `make()` method, and for basic usage, it is sufficient to specify the label and name of the field.

```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Text;

Text::make('Title')
Text::make('Title', 'title')
```

Most often, fields are used within the `FormBuilder`, where they can change the original object based on the request due to the `FormBuilder` itself.

## Modes

The complexity of understanding **MoonShine** fields is due to several visual states.

<a name="default-mode"></a>
### Default Mode

For example, the default visual state for the `Text` field will be `<input type="text"/>`.

<a name="preview-mode"></a>
### Preview Mode

The second mode is for displaying the value of the field.
When outputting a field through `TableBuilder`, we do not need to edit it; we just want to show its contents.
Let's consider the `Image` field; its `preview` view will have an `img` thumbnail or a carousel of images if it is in multiple mode.

Thus, each field looks different, just like the variety of form elements, but they also appear differently in preview mode as they have different purposes.

This has the advantage that we, as developers, do not need to worry about how to display, for example, a `Date` field.
Under the hood, **MoonShine** will perform the formatting, escape text fields for security, or simply make the output more aesthetically pleasing.

<a name="raw-mode"></a>
### Raw Mode

You may not have to use this mode when using the panel.
The point is that it will simply output the value of the field that was originally assigned to it, without any additional modifications.

This mode is ideal for exporting, to ultimately display the original content for further importing.

<a name="life-cycle"></a>
## Field Life Cycle

In the process of declaring fields, you can change the visual states of each of them, but before we look at the examples, let's briefly review the basic life cycle of a field.

**Cycle through FormBuilder**

- the field is declared in the resource,
- the field enters the `FormBuilder`,
- the `FormBuilder` fills the field,
- the `FormBuilder` renders the field,
- upon request, the `FormBuilder` calls the fields and saves the original object using them.

**Cycle through TableBuilder**

- the field is declared in the resource,
- the field enters the `TableBuilder`,
- the `TableBuilder` includes the field in preview mode,
- the `TableBuilder` iterates the original data and transforms it into `TableRow`, pre-filling each field with data,
- the `TableBuilder` renders itself and each of its rows along with the fields.

**Cycle through export**

- the field is declared in the resource in the export method,
- the field enters the `Handler`,
- the `Handler` includes the field in raw mode,
- the `Handler` iterates the original data, fills the fields with it, and generates a table for export based on the raw field values.

Fields in **MoonShine** are not tied to a model (except for the `Slug` field and relationship fields), so their application spectrum is limited only by your imagination.

In the process of interacting with the fields, you may encounter a number of tasks regarding their modification.
All of them will be related to the cycles and states described above. Let's explore them.

<a name="change-preview"></a>
## Change Preview

Let's say you use the `Select` field with options in the form of links to images and want to output not links in preview mode, but to render the images directly.
The result can be achieved using the `change Preview()` method.
Your code will look like this:

```php
// torchlight! {"summaryCollapsedIndicator": "namespaces"}
// [tl! collapse:2]
use MoonShine\UI\Components\Carousel;
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Select;

Select::make('Links')->options([
    '/images/1.png' => 'Picture 1',
    '/images/2.png' => 'Picture 2',
])
    ->multiple() // The field can have multiple values
    ->fill(['/images/1.png', '/images/2.png']) // We filled the field, indicating which values are selected
    ->changePreview(
        fn(?array $values, Select $ctx) => Carousel::make($values)
    ) // changed the preview state
```

As a result, you will get a carousel of images based on the `Select` values; you can return a component or any string.

<a name="change-fill"></a>
## Change Fill

In the process, we also encountered the `fill()` method and filled the field, but if we use it in a ready `ModelResource` or `FormBuilder`, the field will be filled for us, and our called `fill()` method will be overwritten.
Therefore, in your tasks, a situation may arise when you need to change the filling logic, integrate into this process.
For this, the methods `changeFill()` and `afterFill()` will help you.

Let's look at the same example with `Select` and images, but transform the relative path into a full URL.

In this case, the filling happens automatically; these actions will be done for us by `FormBuilder` and ModelResource; we will just change the process:

```php
// torchlight! {"summaryCollapsedIndicator": "namespaces"}
// [tl! collapse:2]
use MoonShine\UI\Components\Carousel;
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Select;

Select::make('Images')->options([
    '/images/1.png' => 'Picture 1',
    '/images/2.png' => 'Picture 2',
])
    ->multiple()
    ->changeFill(
        fn(Article $data, Select $ctx) => $article->images
            ->map(fn($value) => "https://cutcode.dev$value")
            ->toArray()
    )
    ->changePreview(
        fn(?array $values, Select $ctx) => Carousel::make($values)
    ),
```

This method accepts the full object that was passed to the fields by `FormBuilder`, and since we considered the context with ModelResource, our original data was `Model` - `Article`.

In the process, we returned the values necessary for the field but changed the content; we used changePreview from the previous step to demonstrate the result.

Let's consider another example of filling.
Suppose we need to check its value against a certain condition when outputting the `Select` in the table and add a class to the cell if it is met.
Therefore, we need to obtain the final value with which the `Select` is filled, and it is important for us that the filling has already occurred (since the conditional `when()` method is called before filling, and we do not want that).

```php
// torchlight! {"summaryCollapsedIndicator": "namespaces"}
// [tl! collapse:2]
use MoonShine\UI\Components\Carousel;
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Select;

Select::make('Links')->options([
    '/images/1.png' => 'Picture 1',
    '/images/2.png' => 'Picture 2',
])
    ->multiple()
    ->afterFill(
        function(Select $ctx) {
            if(collect($ctx->toValue())->every(fn($value) => str_contains($value, 'cutcode.dev'))) {
                return $ctx->customWrapperAttributes(['class' => 'full-url']);
            }

            return $ctx;
        }
    )
    ->changePreview(
        fn(?array $values, Select $ctx) => Carousel::make($values)
    ),
```

The field builder has wide capabilities, and you can change any states on the fly.
Let's consider a rare case of changing the default visual state, although we do not recommend doing this, and it would be better to create a separate field class for these tasks to extract the logic and reuse the field later.

But let's assume for some reason we want to turn a `Select` field into a `Text` field:

```php
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Select;

Select::make('Links')->options([
    '/images/1.png' => 'Picture 1',
    '/images/2.png' => 'Picture 2',
])
    ->multiple()
    ->changeRender(
        fn(?array $values, Select $ctx) => Text::make($ctx->getLabel())->fill(implode(',', $values))
    )
```

<a name="change-mode"></a>
## Change Display Mode

As we have already realized, fields have different visual states: in `FormBuilder`, by default, it will be a form element, in `TableBuilder` different values display, and for example in export - just the original value.

But let's imagine a situation where we need to output the field in `TableBuilder` not in preview mode but in default mode, or conversely, output it in preview mode inside `FormBuilder` or even in its original:

```php
Text::make('Title')->defaultMode()
```

No matter where we display this field - it will always be in the default mode, as a form element.

```php
Text::make('Title')->previewMode()
```

The same goes for always being in preview mode.

And finally, the mode with the original state:

```php
Text::make('Title')->rawMode()
```

Since we have touched on the topic of `rawMode` and have already discussed the process of changing the filling, let's also take a look at the method that allows us to modify the original value.
For example, we use the field for export, and we do not need to perform subsequent imports; it is necessary to display the value for the manager in a clear format:

```php
use MoonShine\Laravel\Fields\Relationships\BelongsTo;

BelongsTo::make('User')
    ->modifyRawValue(
        fn(int $rawUserId, Article $model, BelongsTo $ctx) => $model->user->name
    )
```

Let's also imagine the situation that you need to do export in a format understandable for managers, but also in the future to import this file.
No matter how smart **MoonShine** is, it will not understand that the value of “Ivan Ivanov” should be found in the table users on the field name and take only id.
This task can be solved as follows:

```php
use MoonShine\Laravel\Fields\Relationships\BelongsTo;

BelongsTo::make('User')
    ->fromRaw(
        fn(string $name) => User::where('name', $name)->value('id')
    )
```

<a name="apply"></a>
## Field Application Process

We already know that fields work with any data, and this is not necessarily a `Model`.
But fields can also modify incoming data.
Simply put, this can be called _saving_, but we do not use this term since fields do not always save.
For instance, the original data may be a `QueryBuilder`, and the fields will act as filters, thus modifying the `QueryBuilder` request, or any other case.
So it is more accurate to say that the fields are "applied" (_apply_).

**Life Cycle of Field Application (using model saving as an example)**

- `FormBuilder` takes the original object; let this be a User model,
- it iterates through the fields passing the `User` object to them and calling the `apply()` method of the field,
- fields within `apply()` take the value from the request based on their column property,
- fields modify the `User` model's attribute based on their column property and return it back,
- afterward, the `FormBuilder` will call the `save()` method of the model,
- additionally, before the `apply()` method of the fields, the `beforeApply()` method will be called if something needs to be done with the object before the main application,
- after the `save()` method of the model, the fields' `afterApply()` method will be called (which in this case is well suited for relationship fields to ensure they have the original object which is already saved in the database).

**Life Cycle of Field Application (using filtering as an example)**

- `FormBuilder` takes the original `QueryBuilder` object,
- it iterates through the fields passing the `QueryBuilder` object to them and calling the `apply()` method of the field,
- fields modify the `QueryBuilder` based on their column property and return it back,
- the `QueryBuilder` object will then be used for data output.

As a result of the knowledge gained and the use of **MoonShine** in real conditions, you may encounter a situation
where you need to change the application logic or add logic before or after the main application of the field.

The field builder allows you to easily achieve these goals on the fly:

```php
// torchlight! {"summaryCollapsedIndicator": "namespaces"}
// [tl! collapse:3]
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;
use MoonShine\UI\Fields\Text;

Text::make('Thumbnail by link', 'thumbnail')
    ->onApply(function(Model $item, $value, Text $field) {
        $path = 'thumbnail.jpg';

        if ($value) {
            $item->thumbnail = Storage::put($path, file_get_contents($value));
        }

        return $item;
    }
)
```

Thus, we simply added a link to the text field, but did not save it as is; rather, we uploaded it and placed it in storage and returned the final path.

We also have the methods `onBeforeApply()` and `onAfterApply()`.

Next, let's take a closer look at the field interface as well as each field separately.
